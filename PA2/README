1. Perhaps the biggest problem that I had with the project was when I was
developing the boolean function to compare the authors' last names. I had 
initially declared it in the .cpp file, but I found that it didn't work. 
Upon debugging, I found that it would always return "0" no matter what the
inputs were. 

Another big issue I had was with ther servers sometime overnight on Tuesday. I
went to work on the project on Wednesday, but found that all of my project
files had been deleted, as well as the entire directory itself.

2. Before class on Monday, I heard people saying that they had the same issue
with their function not working. Someone said that they just did it in their
.h file, and it worked. I took this advice, and it began to work correctly. I'm 
not really sure how or why it worked then.

As for the issue of the deleted project, I had a massive panic attack, then one
of my friends told me about the file recovery process that the CompSci
department has. I was able to go in and retrieve my files with relative ease and
contiue working.

3. I enjoyed this project a lot more than PA1, mostly because I actually
understood most of what I was doing. The instructions were very well laid out
with just enough information to help me when I got stuck with what to do next.
