1. I had every sort of problem with this project, mainly segmentation faults that I couldn't find with gdb, as it wouldn't run properly for me. I kept getting issues with gdb not recognizing the executable, which prevented me from finding some of the segmentation faults. I'm not sure where they came from, but segfaults plagued me on this project. From the start, I knew basically what to do (as described below).
2. I knew that most of the data would be contained in malloc'd arrays, including the file data and parity arrays. As for finding the error in the arrays, it was a simple double-for-loop comparision.
3. Despite all the issues it gave me, I found this project to be enjoyable. I learned a lot from it, including the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference, how to use gdb, and how bad I am at pointers. I also liked the step-by-step approach and the "pick your path" with the 80%, 90%, and 100% options. I used them like stepping stones - complete the 80% first, then the 90%, then the 100%.
